| OK     | only type number it is only searching for id. eg: there is email names as student2@something and also name as 3, so typing 3 is not giving anything.      |
| OK     | Search functionality is wrong, if you add @ in the name, it wonâ€™t search with that name                                                                   |
| OK     | search is on click rather than on change or debounce.                                                                                                     |
| OK     | after typing 3 and searching if I try to type nothing (empty) and search it gives 400.                                                                    |
| OK     | Student id is not autogenerating, you have to give it manually.                                                                                           |
| OK     | 1st page result is saved. So if you search anything, then make the search box empty and press enter (from any page, let's say 4). It's sending me default |
| OK     | No sort on emails                                                                                                                                         |
| OK     | No search on subjects                                                                                                                                     |
| OK     | In case of error, the page is just loading, instead of showing any error                                                                                  |
| OK     | If the wrong search is made, the app crashes.                                                                                                             |
